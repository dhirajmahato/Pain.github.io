title: Indian Migrant Workers
description: The endless journey of struggle
---

### Introduction:
Labour migration within India is crucial for economic growth and contributes to improving the socio-economic condition of people. Migration can help, for example, to improve income, skill development, and provide greater access to services like healthcare and education.

### Facts:
As per Census 2011, the total number of internal migrants would be 450 million. 
During 2017–18, it was estimated that a quarter of the workforce (that is, approximately 117 million workers) was usually engaged in casual work.

### Legislation Support
India’s labour legislations have been wedged into two definitional quagmires: worker and non-worker. 
Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), 1947 

### challenges: 

#### Socio-economic security

The major area of work they are engaged in would be agriculture labour, brick kilns, construction sites, services (maids to watchmen to drivers) industrial non-skilled workers, small and tiny road side businesses (tea shops, dhabas, small ­eateries, hotels, restaurants, etc).1 This entire workforce falls under the informal sector, which, of course, constitutes 93% of India’s total workforce. 

A non-workman category of employment has emerged in Indian labour laws that falls outside the purview of labour legislation, and the majority of them are informal workers without any collective bargaining power.

National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) as well as the census fail to capture the short-term seasonal movements.

The casual wage labourers in both farm and non-farm enterprises are not covered under currently existing social security legislations in India. 


#### Covid19:
The lockdown has not only inflicted incorrigible damages on the working lives of migrant, informal and precarious workers, but has induced a slump in activities of all sectors, from production to distribution to consumption. As India’s nationwide lockdown will be lifted,the uncertainly of livelihood, wage loss and lay-offs is likely to linge.

A soft law approach has been executed through an advisory from Ministry of Labour and Employment on 20 March 2020 requiring all employers/establishments not to terminate employees and not to cut wages of the workers, including contract and temporary workers : under the category of regular wage/salary employment i.e organised sector
Also Central government has used the power conferred under Section 10(2)(1) of the Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005 to order all employers to make payment of wages.


### Way Ahead:
The report of the second National Commission on Labour recommends that the Mathadi model can be adopted for the unorganised sector all over India.
The report also urges the codification of existing labour laws based on the Draft Indian Labour Code prepared in 1994 by the National Labour Law Association.





The fundamental challenge is regarding the reorganisation of the economy that would eliminate the possibility of distress migration.
