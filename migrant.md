### Introduction:
Migration : Distress or opportunity-oriented

Labour migration within India is crucial for economic growth and contributes to improving the socio-economic condition of people. Migration can help, for example, to improve income, skill development, and provide greater access to services like healthcare and education.
But it is not the only reason as most of the migration is for subsistence and survival and falls under the citatory of distress migration.

### Stats:
In 2012, there were around 487 million workers in India, Of these over 93% work in unincorporated, unorganised enterprises ranging from pushcart vendors to home-based diamond and gem polishing operations.

According to the Census 2011 the total number of internal migrants in the country (inter- and intra-state movement) at a staggering 139 million. Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar are the biggest source states of migrants and major destination states are Delhi, Maharashtra.

According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (2017–18), 238 million workers work as self-employed and around 112 million are employed in the casual labour segment.

> The unorganised/informal sector refers to those enterprises whose activities or collection of data is not regulated under any legal provision or do not maintain any regular accounts

### Legislation Support:
India’s labour legislations have been wedged into two definitional quagmires: worker and non-worker.

- Inter-State Migrant Workmen (ISMW) Act, 1979.
- Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act (1986)
- Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act (1996)
- Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008
- Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act (1970)


### Challenges: 

##### Back at Home
Failed development contributes to the continuation of poor resource bases and assets of marginal and small farmers, which in turn create severe economic deprivation and entrenched social discrimination and compelled them to move out.

Also,Migration is not a reflection of failed agricultural policy alone. It can be viewed as a risk diversification strategy, and the remittances do contribute a share in household incomes.

Due to young male population out-migrating, increasingly characterised by the **feminisation of agriculture**, distress-induced participation of women.

##### In Cities

The major area of work they are engaged in would be agriculture labour, brick kilns, construction sites, services (maids to watchmen to drivers) industrial non-skilled workers, small and tiny road side businesses (tea shops, dhabas, small eateries, hotels, restaurants, etc). 

This entire workforce falls under the informal sector, which, of course, constitutes 93% of India’s total workforce. 

##### Categorization
A non-workman category of employment has emerged in Indian labour laws that falls outside the purview of labour legislation, and the majority of them are informal workers without any collective bargaining power.

National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) as well as the census fail to capture the short-term seasonal movements.

The casual wage labourers in both farm and non-farm enterprises are not covered under currently existing social security legislations in India. 


##### Covid19 
The lockdown has not only inflicted incorrigible damages on the working lives of migrant, informal and precarious workers, but has induced a slump in activities of all sectors, from production to distribution to consumption. As India’s nationwide lockdown will be lifted,the uncertainly of livelihood, wage loss and lay-offs is likely to linge.

###### Temporary relief
A soft law approach has been executed through an advisory from Ministry of Labour and Employment on 20 March 2020 requiring all employers/establishments not to terminate employees and not to cut wages of the workers, including contract and temporary workers : under the category of regular wage/salary employment i.e organised sector.

Also Central government has used the power conferred under Section 10(2)(1) of the Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005 to order all employers to make payment of wages.

> The fundamental challenge is regarding the reorganisation of the economy that would eliminate the possibility of distress migration. 

### Suggestions:

- Enlarging the scope of Unorganised Workers’ Social Security (UWSS) Act, 2008 to include legal entitlements, to define the migrant workman as a subset, to provide for contingencies of livelihood loss and to make the Act legally enforceable.
- Universalisation of registration and issuance of Aadhaar-based Unique Worker’s Identification Number (UWIN).
- Schemes like MGNREGA, Public Distribution Scheme (PDS) and Ujjwala need to be made portable and extensive.
- Geofencing of different benefits enabling a migrant worker to choose location-wise benefits.
- Preparing a comprehensive database of the migrant workers’ source and destination, demography, employment patterns and skill sets.
- The report of the second National Commission on Labour recommends that the Mathadi model can be adopted for the unorganised sector all over India.The report also urges the codification of existing labour laws based on the Draft Indian Labour Code prepared in 1994 by the National Labour Law Association.
